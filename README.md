# graphene-grain-boundary
Inspired by the algorithm proposed by Ophus et. al. in their paper titled "Large-Scale Experimental and Theoretical Study of Graphene Grain Boundary Structures", 2015, this study is aimed to create a novel python script to generate atomistic structures of graphene grain boundary.
